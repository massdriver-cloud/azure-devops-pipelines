## About the Mass CLI extension

The Mass CLI extension utilizes the [Mass CLI's](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/cli/overview) command-line capabilities to provide a set of tasks that can be used in Azure DevOps pipelines. These tasks empower you to integrate Massdriver into CI/CD pipelines, and to automate the update of Massdriver-managed infrastructure and applications. The extension has the following tasks:

* [Install Mass CLI](https://github.com/massdriver-cloud/mass/releases)
* [Build and push Docker image](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/cli/commands/mass_image_push)
* [Publish bundle changes](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/cli/commands/mass_bundle_publish)
* [Update bundle configuration](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/cli/commands/mass_application_patch)
* [Deploy bundle changes](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/cli/commands/mass_application_deploy)
